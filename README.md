#  Pokemon finder app built with GraphQL + React

Built a simple pokemon web application which displays all the pokemons and allows user search for a pokemon by its name. The data is fetched with the a GraphQL server for the backend, and a GraphQL cleint - ApolloClient for the client side. GraphQL was used to parse the query before send to the ApolloClient. Hooks from the ApolloClient were used for querying the database and map out the pokemon information
